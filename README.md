# Project-2
Crowdfunding ETL

It's an ETL mini project, to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 

After data is transformed, it was created four CSV files and they were used to create an ERD and a table schema. 

Finally, the CSV file data was uploaded into a Postgres database.
